  <p class="lead">
    For nearly 20 years, NITLE operated to "stimulate collaboration between selected liberal arts colleges and to act as a catalyst for the effective integration of emerging and newer digital technologies into teaching, learning, scholarship, and information management." As higher education has continued to evolve over the last two decades, so have the services and collaboration platforms that NITLE was initially designed to encourage. After <a href="https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub172/">much analysis</a>, the decision to cease operations was made in November 2017.</p>

  <p class="lead"> We would like to thank everyone who contributed to the projects and technologies that benefited so many.
